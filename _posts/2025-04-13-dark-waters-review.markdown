Last night the wife and I watched [Dark Waters](https://amzn.to/42cOKGU). Excellent movie. At some points felt slightly overacted. However, I appreciated not condensing the timeline for the artificial sense of action in a lawyer movie.

It gave a great sense of the amount of time invested for the right outcome, and even then the work continues on.

Definitely motivating as I consider pursuing law after the military career.
